#### If you are having problems related to your interactive board, there are two ways that you can help us help you, please do BOTH of these steps as it makes it a LOT easier to help you to investigate the issue.
**1)** Please navigate to **Settings -> Open Root Folder** Then open user-settings -> controls and attach the .json file of the board you are having issues with, as well as the **latest log file in the user-settings -> logs folder** put these files in a ZIP-file before attaching them.

**2)** Go to Mixer's Interactive Studio, click "Edit" on the board you are having issues with, click on the share icon beside the board name up top in the right corner of the page, choose "Only allow specific", and then add in our names (Firebottle, ebiggz, kateract, and ThePerry).
This allows us to easily test your board. Thanks!
