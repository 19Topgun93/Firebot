# Firebot
An app to run various interactive buttons for mixer.pro streamers.

## Remastered?
The original Firebot was just a plain js file that I kept building on. This version, the remastered edition, takes what I built and layers it on top of my other project mixerChatPlays. All of this will run as a desktop app and allow people to use a multitude of different types of interactive buttons.

## Can I use it now?
Yes, just head on over to [the releases page](https://github.com/Firebottle/Firebot/releases) and download the newest version!
