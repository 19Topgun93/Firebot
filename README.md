# Firebot
A bot for use on beam.pro/firebottle that can do many different things and changes all the time. 

## Description
This is the bot that I use on my Beam channel. I've put it on github so that other beam developers can hopefully take some of these ideas and make them their own.

## Can I use this on my channel?
Sure, but I can't provide support in getting it running. All I ask is that you change it to make the bot yours. Don't directly copy everything in here. If I see my logo pop up a clicker boss on your channel I'll be a very sad robot.
