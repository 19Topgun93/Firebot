# Firebot
An app to run various interactive buttons for beam.pro streamers.

## Remastered?
The original Firebot was just a plain js file that I kept building on. This version, the remastered edition, takes what I built and layers it on top of my other project BeamChatPlays. All of this will run as a desktop app and allow people to use a multitude of different types of interactive buttons.

## Can I use it now?
Nope. It's not yet released to the public. But... it will be soon! Once this is released it will replace BeamChatPlays.
=======
NOTE: Current working branch is FirebotRemastered. After initial public release it will be merged into master.
